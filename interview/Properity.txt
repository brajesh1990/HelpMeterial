1. Property is fundamental concept in OOPs of encapsulation that allows you to control access to the data stored within a class. 
2. It similar to variable but they are access using getter and setter method.
3. Using the setter and getter method we can define a controlled way to read, write, enforce the logic and validate of the property value

example---
private int age;

    // Property to get and set the age
    public int Age
    {
        get
        {
            return age;
        }
        set
        {
            if (value >= 0 && value <= 120)
            {
                age = value;
            }
            else
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("Age must be between 0 and 120.");
            }
        }
    }
